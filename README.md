# PROJECT NAME: ANTONIO'S PIZZA PLACE
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION: JQUERY FORM SUBMIT LISTENER
### AUTHOR: EMMANUEL OREGA
#### SET UP INSTRUCTIONS
- In the primary folder, where the project is to be, create two more folders of css and js where bootstrap and jquery files are added respectively.
- Jquery is added either by downloading the file form the jquery website or pasting its CDN link to the HTML file, though, the use of the CDN link is
  more preferrable because it will load  faster but its demerit is that it requires internet connection.
- The addition of jquery will tell the webpage what it is thus enabling the adding of jquery functions in the custom javascript file.   
- In the css folder, a custom stylesheet file  is also created for one have place his or her own styling to the webpage.
- Afterwards, one can begin writing the webpage.
- The files in css and js folders are always linked to the HTML file for the styling and effects of jqueries to be impacted on the webpage.
- The HTML file is always given the name "index.html" because without it the webpage can't be visible on Github pages hence bringing about an error.
- As you write the webpage, always commit the changes made.
- When done writing the webpage, the code can be pushed to be remote repository on Github and also Github pages.
